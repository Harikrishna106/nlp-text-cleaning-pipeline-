# NLP Text Preprocessing and Analysis
This Jupyter Notebook (nlp.ipynb) provides a practical demonstration of fundamental Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It walks through the process of taking raw, unstructured text data, cleaning it, transforming it, and extracting valuable insights using popular Python libraries.

## Key NLP Steps Covered:
The notebook illustrates the following essential stages of an NLP pipeline:

### Initial Setup & Downloads: Importing necessary libraries (NLTK, spaCy, TextBlob, scikit-learn) and downloading required linguistic data.
Text Cleaning: Standardizing text by converting to lowercase, removing punctuation, and digits.
Tokenization & Stop Word Removal: Breaking down text into individual words (tokens) and filtering out common, less informative words.
Lemmatization: Reducing words to their base or dictionary form (e.g., "running" to "run") for consistent analysis.
Named Entity Recognition (NER): Identifying and classifying named entities (like persons, organizations, locations) within the text.
TF-IDF Vectorization: Converting text data into a numerical format (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) that machine learning models can process.
Sentiment Analysis: Determining the emotional tone (polarity) and objectivity/subjectivity of the text.
Slang & Spelling Correction: Addressing informal language and common misspellings to improve text quality.

#### Setup and Dependencies:
To run this notebook, ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the required libraries using pip:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn nltk spacy textblob
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

The notebook includes commands to download specific NLTK datasets (stopwords, punkt, punkt_tab) upon first run.
